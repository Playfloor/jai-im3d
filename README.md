# Im3d for Jai
[Im3d](https://github.com/john-chapman/im3d) bindings for the [Jai](https://youtu.be/TH9VCN6UkyQ) programming language.

## Disclaimer
**The Jai programming language is still in closed beta as of December 27 2020.**

The library currently uses a **dll**, which is not necessarily the best choice so we'll eventually change it to link statically if possible. 

## Supported platforms
Currently, only Windows is supported.

## Dependencies
This library is currently dependant on my [linear algebra module](https://github.com/ostef/jai-modules) for `Vec2` and `Vec4` as well as the `Basic` an `Math` modules provided with the Jai compiler.

## License
We use the same license as **Im3d** which is the **MIT License**.
